## About Me

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobliedke/jacobliedke.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I am a senior at the George Washington University studying political communication in the School of Media and Public Affairs. I am passionate about learning more about the relationship between new media technologies and forms of contentious political behavior.
