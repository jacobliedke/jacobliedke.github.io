### About Me

I am a senior at the George Washington University studying political communication in the School of Media and Public Affairs. I am passionate about learning more about the relationship between new media technologies and forms of contentious political behavior.

### R Projects

[Here](https://jacobliedke.github.io/RHomework/) is one of my R projects from earlier this semester. This HTML site was built using R Markdown and visualizes how some House Democrats voted during the impeachment of Donald Trump.

My next R project from this semester, a visualization of some data from the Biden administration's transition website, can be viewed [here](https://jacobliedke.github.io/BidenTransition/).

### Resume

### Research

You can read some of my research papers from my undergraduate courses below.

[Here](https://jacobliedke.github.io/Research/whole_country_is_watching.pdf) is the final copy of my undergraduate thesis, titled The Whole Country Is Watching: National Cable News Coverage of the Police Shooting of Jacob Blake and Subsequent Protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The research explores how cable television news framed the shooting of Jacob Blake, the protests that followed, as well as the shooting by Kyle Rittenhouse a few nights later.

You can also access my final research paper from my Data Analysis course [here](https://jacobliedke.github.io/Research/data_analysis_research.pdf). The survey research sought to investigate how people would respond to priming of a political candidate's inconsistent record.

My final paper from Introduction to Political Communication was a literature review discussing the concept of performance as a consistent theme throughout the field of political communication. It can be accessed [here](https://jacobliedke.github.io/Research/performancec_in_polcomm.pdf).
